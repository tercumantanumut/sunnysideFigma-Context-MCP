# Changelog

All notable changes to the Sunnyside Figma MCP project.

## [Latest] - 2025-06-24

### üîß Latest Fix - All Layers CSS Restoration

#### Fixed All Layers CSS Generation
- **Issue**: `get_All_Layers_CSS` function was returning "Unable to fetch all layers CSS data from server"
- **Root Cause**: Missing `allLayersCSS` field generation in Figma plugin after code refactoring
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive CSS generation for all design layers
- **Enhancement**: Added recursive layer traversal with performance optimization

#### Technical Implementation
- **New Function**: `generateAllLayersCSS()` - Recursively processes all layers in design hierarchy
- **CSS Generation**: Uses native Figma `getCSSAsync()` API when available, fallback to custom CSS
- **Class Name Sanitization**: Converts Figma layer names to valid CSS class names
- **Performance Optimization**: Limited recursion depth to 5 levels to prevent performance issues
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for problematic nodes

#### Results
- **‚úÖ Complete Layer Coverage**: CSS for all frames, text, vectors, groups, and child elements
- **‚úÖ Proper Structure**: Maintains design hierarchy with descriptive comments
- **‚úÖ Native CSS Quality**: Leverages Figma's official CSS generation when possible
- **‚úÖ Production Ready**: Clean, formatted CSS output ready for use

### üÜï Major Enhancements

#### Fixed TokenId Display Consistency
- **Issue**: Token change impact analysis showed inconsistent token IDs (e.g., "fill-0" instead of "color-fill-0")
- **Fix**: Updated `formatImpactAnalysisReport` function to use correct `tokenId` parameter
- **Impact**: All tools now display consistent token identifiers across the system

#### Enhanced File Scanning System
- **Issue**: Dependency graph building returned "0 files scanned" due to path resolution problems
- **Fix**: Implemented proper recursive file discovery with absolute path resolution
- **Improvement**: Now successfully scans 5+ files vs 0 before
- **Added**: Comprehensive logging for debugging file scanning issues

#### Advanced Conflict Detection
- **New**: Real-time detection of design token conflicts and inconsistencies
- **Features**:
  - Token naming conflicts (duplicate tokens with different names)
  - Hardcoded value conflicts (values that should be tokens)
  - Semantic conflicts (tokens used for wrong purposes)
  - Accessibility conflicts (color contrast issues)
  - Responsive conflicts (inconsistent responsive token usage)

#### Multi-format Health Reports
- **New**: Support for multiple health report formats
- **Formats**:
  - `actionable` - Focused on immediate actions with suggestions
  - `detailed` - Comprehensive analysis with full context
  - `summary` - Brief overview for dashboards
- **Fix**: Resolved empty output issue for health tracking

### üîß Technical Improvements
